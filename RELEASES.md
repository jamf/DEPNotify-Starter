# Releases and DEPNotify Versions

This page is to document version of the DEPNotify script in relation to the DEPNotify app. Script and app versions are independent of one another and can be confusing as releases continue.

## 1.1.3 of DEPNotify app
Due to changes with menu.depnotify.plist, it was easier to update the script without backwards compatibility. As such v.2.0.0 of the script only supports this version of the app

## 1.1.0 of DEPNotify app
Several updates to the script support version 1.1.0. Technically even 1.2.0 would work with 1.1.0 if not using EULA or Registration window. However, it is recommended that the latest version of the script is used that is compatible with the version of DEPNotify you are using.
